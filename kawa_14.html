<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="kawa_toc.html#TOC72">License for the Kawa software</A></H2>

<P>
The license for Kawa and the packages it depends on
is a "modified Gnu Public License".  You can find it in
the file <CODE>COPYING</CODE> in the Kawa sources, and
also quoted here:.



<PRE>
The Java classes (with related files and documentation) in these packages
are copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999  Per Bothner.

These classes are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

These classes are free software.  You can use and re-distribute a class
without restriction (in source or binary form) as long as you use a
version that has not been modified in any way from a version released
by Per Bothner, Cygnus Solutions, or the Free Software Foundation.
You may make and distribute a modified version, provided you follow
the terms of the GNU General Public License; either version 2,
or (at your option) any later version.
</PRE>

<P>
The file <CODE>COPYING</CODE> also contains a copy of the
GNU General Public License version 2.


<P>
People have asked what the Kawa license means in practice.
Informally, you get to pick between these choices:

<OL>
<LI>

Use Kawa as distributed by Per Bothner, Cygnus Solutions, or the
Free Software Foundation (or their approved agents),
with no modifications.  In that case, you can use Kawa for any
purpose you like, and distribute your application with any license
you like.  (This basically gives you the same rights as
a typical commercial royalty-free re-distribution license.)
<LI>

Obey the terms of the standard Gnu Public License.  (See
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</A>).  Informally, this means
that if you distribute any application that is based on Kawa, you must
also make available to all your recipients (customers) the source code
for your entire application, giving them the modification and
re-distribution rights they have under the GPL.  In a Java context, I take
"entire application" to mean all classes (and native code) that run in
the same Java virtual machine, except for the Java runtime system itself
(the virtual machine, low-level run-time system, and any classes in
a <CODE>java</CODE> or <CODE>javax</CODE> package).
<LI>

If you need to make a change to Kawa, you can submit them to Per Bothner,
and convince him to include them in future Kawa releases.
<LI>

You can negotiate some other (commercial) license with Per Bothner.
</OL>

<P>
In general, if the license of Kawa or associated packages causes
difficulties, let me know.
