<P>
JEmacs is included in the Kawa distribution.  It is a project to
re-implement Emacs, allowing a mix of Java. Scheme, and Emacs Lisp.
It has its own <A HREF="http://www.jemacs.net/">home-page</A>.


<P>
BRL ("the Beautiful Report Language") is a database-oriented language
to embed in HTML and other markup.
<A HREF="http://brl.sourceforge.net/">BRL</A> allows you to embed Scheme in
a an HTML file on a web server.


<P>
The Health Media Research Laboratory, part of the Comprehensive Cancer
Center at the University of Michigan, is using Kawa as an integral part of
its core tailoring technologies. Java programs using Kawa libraries are used
to administer customized web-based surveys, generate tailored feedback,
validate data, and "characterize," or transform, data. Kawa code is embedded
directly in XML-formatted surveys and data dictionaries. Performance and
ease of implementation has far exceeded expectations. For more information
contact Paul R. Potts, Technical Director, Health Media Research Lab,
<CODE>&#60;potts@umich.edu&#62;</CODE>.


<P>
Mike Dillon (<CODE>mdillon@gjt.org</CODE>)
did the preliminary work of creating a
Kawa plugin for jEdit. It is called SchemeShell and provides a REPL inside
of the jEdit console for executing expressions in Kawa (much as the BeanShell
plugin does with the BeanShell scripting language).
It is currently available only via CVS from:

<PRE>
CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jedit.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jedit
MODULE=plugins/SchemeShell
</PRE>

<P>
STMicroelectronics (<CODE>marco.vezzoli@st.com</CODE>)
uses Kawa in a prototypal
intranet 3tier information retrival system as a communication protocol
between server and clients and to do server agents programming.


<P>
Bossa is a research programming language that has a Java-like syntax,
and features multiple dispatch
methods, quantified parametric types, higher-order functions, and the new
concept of "abstract interfaces".
The Bossa compiler uses Kawa's <CODE>gnu.expr</CODE> and <CODE>gnu.bytecode</CODE>
packages to generate Java bytecode.
A GPLed release is planned. For more information feel free to contact
Daniel Bonniot (<CODE>d.bonniot@mail.dotcom.fr</CODE>).
