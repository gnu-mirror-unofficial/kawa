<P>
Kawa is a full Scheme implementation.  It implements almost
all of R5RS (for exceptions see section <A HREF="kawa_6.html#SEC13">Features of R5RS not implemented</A>), plus some extensions.
By default, symbols are case sensitive.


<P>
It is completely written in Java.  Scheme functions and files
are automatically compiled into Java byte-codes.  Kawa does some
optimizations, and the compiled code runs at reasonable speed.


<P>
Kawa provides the usual read-eval-print loop, as well as batch modes.


<P>
Kawa is written in an object-oriented style.


<P>
Kawa implements most of the features of the expression language of DSSSL,
the Scheme-derived ISO-standard Document Style Semantics and Specification
Language for SGML.  Of the core expression language, the only features
missing are character properties, <CODE>external-procedure</CODE>,
the time-relationed procedures, and character name escapes in
string literals.  Also, Kawa is not generally tail-recursive.
From the full expression language, Kawa additionally is missing
<CODE>format-number</CODE>, <CODE>format-number-list</CODE>, and language objects.
Quantities, keyword values, and the expanded <CODE>lambda</CODE> form
(with optional and keyword parameters) are supported.
